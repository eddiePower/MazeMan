<h2>MAZEMAN GAME</h2>
<p>By Eddie Power, 2018</p>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>A very simple iOS 12.1 compatable game using the gyroscope and CoreMotion library to animate some images (pacman look a like).
No real skill needed at the moment to win the game and is a little easy to die.
Will adapt more stuff soon..</p>
<h4>TODO List:</h4>
* Add Restart Game method - restart motion update, re position pm and ghosts,
* Add restart game button on Winning pop up,
* Correct game restart on death pop up event,
* Add random positioning system of wall tile array items on startup,
* Add scoring for reaching the level goal with increasing point sytem per level,
* Change ghost speed on level increase,
*  Work out ghost positioning system based on wall tile array locations,
* Create a main menu system - game, info, high scores.
* Create high scoring and high score records methods - use flat file writes,
* Incorperate Core Data for score keeping once flat file write works - V2.0 highscores,
* Stop wasting time on a silly game lol,
